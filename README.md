This repository contains my explorations and notes for the JavaScript30 course by
  [Wes Bos](//github.com/wesbos). I hope this helps me as a developer to enhance my current skillset and reduce any reliance on external JS libraries; **if it can be done with a JS library,
  it can (probably) be done with vanilla JS.** Keeping my learning process in mind I wrote these as both a reference, and a way to build the repetitive muscle memory via practice. I hope someone may find these helpful/useful and can relate to my learning process.

**DISCLAIMER:** My approach to the challenges follows along with Wes' provided answers (found in
  the files that end with `-FINISHED` on the main repo). I try to provide thorough comments and explanations when I iterate through what Wes teaches. 

## About

The goal is to build 30 things in 30 days with vanilla JavaScript; no frameworks, libraries, etc.
  Pacing is totally up to the individual; The idea behind these exercises is to utilize small amounts of what would regularly be 'downtime' as moments in which we can build on our knowledge through some simple exercises.

I think it's fair to say that, coming into this course, it's expected that you should have a decent grasp of JavaScript fundamentals. Comfort when working with functions, callbacks, arrays,
and objects will help a great deal in working through the challenges. As of writing this I definitely fall into the latter category. I try to follow the mantra of **don't worry and do it anyways** &lt;3. It might take you more than downtime to complete a challenge, but given that these exercises require you to work with those very topics time and time again, JavaScript30 is still an excellent learning resource.
