# DnD: TL;DR

## A Fast and Loose Guide to Dungeons and Dragons

_Too long, didn't read: This guide makes DnD super fun and easy._

This guide is for new players. Dungeons and Dragons is fun, but can be seen as super complicated or overwhelming. A lot of the rules are not necessary to get started, and its ok to learn as you go. The "Rule-of-Cool" will always win. We prefer fun and hilarity over rule-following.c

## Basic Overview

_TL;DR: Invent a character, explore a fantasy world, talk to the people living there, fight crazy monsters, acquire plunder and glory, roll dice, drink beers, yell at your friends and have fun._

Dungeons and Dragons is a fantasy role playing game. The game is played by 4-6 **player characters**, who play as adventurers exploring a world, and one **Dungeon Master**, who controls the context of the adventure and plays as the **non-player characters** and **monsters**.

Creativity and ingenuity are rewarded. The players will be placed into challenging situations, (such as fighting an army of monsters, discovering and deciphering mysterious clues, and interrogating, seducing and deceiving non-player characters), and will have to use their imaginations to devise ways to overcome those challenges.

#### Goals

The goal of the game is simply to play the game, because it is fun!

Generally, the Dungeon Master is trying to steer you onto a fun quest, but ultimately, it's all up to you. Want to start a peasant revolt against the evil king? Go ahead! Want to turn a dragon into your pet and become the ruler of the land? Roll for it! Want to start a seedy brothel? Uh, sure!

The only limits are your imagination and the rolls of dice. Have fun!

#### Mechanics

The primary mechanic of the game is the roll of a 20-sided dice known as a **D20**. Players state what they want to do (for instance, _"I want to use the rope to swing across the chasm"_), and then roll a D20. 

The Dungeon Master decides themselves how difficult that task is (out of 20), and if the dice scores higher than that number then the player succeeds, and if not then they fail. The Dungeon Master then narrates the result of the action (_"You try to swing across the gaping chasm, but your grip slips half-way across, and you fall to the canyon floor. You take two damage. You see glowing eyes in the darkness."_)

Natural rolls of 1 and 20 result in spectacular failures and success, respectively. These will be narrated accordingly.

## Making Characters üë´
_TL;DR: Choose a character type. Print a [premade sheet](/Characters/README.md). In a pinch, pretend to be Han Solo or Darth Vader but as a Lord of the Rings character._

<!--Character creation is the longest, most confusing and most boring part of the game for new players. We're going to skip all of the pointless parts and just get to the good stuff.-->

Every player besides the Dungeon Master needs to create a character. Each player will need to choose a [**race**](#race), a [**class**](#class), an [**alignment**](#alignment), and a [**name**](#name). This will be something like _Riceak Beestinger, Chaotic Gnomish Druid_, or _Hollyatra Gellantara, Lawful Human Paladin_. Choose a combination that you think will be fun to play as.

You'll probably want to make sure that your party has good a balance of skills and personalities. _You can't all be Han Solo!_

### Race
_TL;DR: What do you look like?_

Race defines the **general physical characterics** of your character. 

Race can affect how people interact with your character. Non-player characters in the games may have their own racial prejudices - for instances, if you go to a Dwarven cave, the Dwarves there might be racist towards your Elf player. This can lead to some funny situations. 

Also, big characters can throw small characters, which is always funny.

Choose one:

| Race    | Size | Attributes|
|:------------- |:----------------|:-------------|
| Halfling      | Tiny | Nimble, brave (basically just Hobbits) |
| Gnome      | Very Small | Cunning, sees in the dark |
| Dwarf      | Small | Resilient, sees in the dark |
| Elf      | Short | Keen senses, sees in the dark |
| Half-Elf      | Short-ish | Rare, skilled, diplomatic |
| Tiefling      | Regular | Has horns and a tail |
| Human        | Regular | You know what humans are |
| Half-Orc        | Tall | Savage |
| Dragonborn       | Taller | Scales, tough |
| Aarakocra       | Short | Feathers, Can fly |
| Harengon       | Small | Hugh Jackman as a Hare |
| Warforged       | Regular | If Data and Robocop had a baby |

### Class
_TL;DR: What can you do?_

Class defines the **skills and abilities** of your character. 

Some can use magic, some are good at melee combat, some are good at ranged weaponry, and some are good at seduction. Pick the one that you think would be fun role play as!

| Class    | Quality | Good at |
|:------------- |:----------------|:-------------|
| Barbarian      | Strong | Hitting things |
| Bard      | Musical | Seduction |
| Cleric      | Religious magic | Healing |
| Druid      | Natural magic | Potions, plants/animals |
| Fighter    | Combat | Fighting. Duh. |
| Monk      | Religious kung-fu | Kung-fu, potions, plants/animals |
| Paladin      | Religious knight | Religious violence, chivalry |
| Ranger      | Scouting | Archery, stealth |
| Rogue      | Criminal | Thievery, lockpicking, ruses |
| Sorcerer      | Energy magic | Cool spells |
| Warlock      | War magic | Cool spells |
| Wizard      | General magic | Cool spells |

### Alignment
_TL;DR: How do you behave - good or bad? Lawful or criminal?_

Alignment describes your character's **motivations and behavior**. There are two axis here: good and evil, lawful and chaotic. These map pretty well to archetypical movie characters, Darth Vader is lawful evil, Han Solo is chaotic neutral, etc. 

Again, choose one you think would be fun:

| | | |
|:------------- |:----------------|:-------------|
| **Lawful Good** (Superman) | **Neutral Good** (Gandalf) | **Chaotic Good** (Batman) |
| **Lawful Neutral** (Stannis Baratheon) | **True Neutral** (Saul Goodman) | **Chaotic Neutral** (Han "Shot First" Solo) |
| **Lawful Evil** (Darth Vader) | **Neutral Evil** (Voldemort)  | **Chaotic Evil** (The Joker) |

### Name

Finally, make a name. A good DM will enforce that you call all the other players by their character names.

Alternately, you can just use this [character name generator](https://www.wizards.com/dnd/article5.asp?x=dnd/dx20010202b) and see what happens.

### Character Sheets

Now that you've chosen your **race**, **class**, **alignment** and **name**, please follow the link to our campaign [DnDBeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) and create a free account to generate your character. It is a fully intuitive character builder and very robust character sheet. This character sheet will also link up to our discord server. You can get the link from the **_weblinks_** channel.

#### Important Numbers

On your sheet, there are a few important numbers. **Hit Points (HP)**, which are how much damage you can take before you die, **Armour Class (AC)**, which is how well you are defended against enemy blows, and six **ability modifiers**, which are numbers added to your rolls for certain tasks. They correspond to:

| Ability    | Meaning | Modifies |
|:------------- |:----------------|:-------------|
| Strength (STR)  | Physical strength | Moving things, hitting things, breaking doors, doing damage |
| Dexterity (DEX) | Gymnastic ability | Generates armour class, climbing, dodging, balancing, archery |
| Constitution (CON) | Health and stamina | Generates hit points, concentration |
| Intelligence (INT) | Reasoning and learning | Deciphering, appraising, forgery, searching, spellcasting |
| Wisdom (WIS) | Knowledge, gut feelings | Knowing arcane knowledge, sensing traps and secrets, listening, healing |
| Charisma (CHA) | Seductive ability | Seduction, charm, deception, disguise, animal taming |

When you try to do one of the those types of things, add your modifier to your roll. 

<!--Armour class is:
10 + armor bonus + shield bonus + Dexterity modifier
Hit Points are:-->

## Gameplay üé≤
_TL;DR: Just roll a D20 and see what happens._

Okay! Now you're ready to play. Before your first game the Dungeon Master is going to read a little narative exposition, then you're off!

There are three pillars to gameplay: **exploration** of the game world, **interaction** with non-player characters, and **combat** with monsters.

### Exploration üîç
_TL;DR: Look for clues, traps, treasure and secrets._

Exploration is the primary mechanic when there are no non-player characters or monsters around. This usually means **looking around** the environment for clues or secrets, discovering or using items, or solving puzzles. Gameplay elements often involve, but aren't limited to:

* Solving puzzles
* Surmounting obstacles (climbing walls, lockpicking, etc.)
* Looking for treasure
* Taming animals
* Stealthy intrusion and escape
* Discovering and setting traps
* Starting fires and other diversions

### Interaction üí¨
_TL;DR: Use disguises and charisma to acquire information._

Eventually, players will encounter **non-player characters**. These might be guards, townsfolk, nobility, evil generals, holy spirits or anything else. Generally, they will have some information for the players that they'll need to acquire somehow. This isn't always easy, and often involves the use of:

* Threats of violence
* Disguise, forgery, trickery and slight-of-hand
* Bribery
* Kidnapping, interrogation, and torture
* Seduction
* Navigating racial discrimination and crossing language barriers

### Combat ‚öî
_TL;DR: Roll a D20 to see if you hit or not, then roll another dice to see how much damage you did._

At some point, players will encounter **violent monsters**. There are no limits to how they can interact with those monsters, but there are rules for melee (sword-type), ranged (bow-type) and magic combat.

As a rule of thumb, a player's turn represents about **10 seconds** of elapsed game time. So, if a player wants to climb a ladder, untie a rope and swing into a monster, that would take successful rolls across three turns.

Combat strikes happen in two phases (in the same turn): rolls to hit, and rolls to deal damage.

#### Attacking

To attack, a player declares who they are going to hit and what they want to hit with. For example, _"I strike at the nearest Goblin with my hand-axe."_

The attack roll is a normal **D20 roll, plus the Attack bonus** (STR or DEX + Proficiency) listed on the character sheet for that weapon. If the resulting number is greater than or equal to the enemy's Armour Class, then the attack counts as a hit. If not, then the attack misses, and the turn passes to the next player.

If the attack roll is a hit, then the player rolls another dice (listed on the character sheet for each weapon), and that number is subtracted from the monster's hit points. If resulting hit points are less than zero, then the monster dies.

**Natural 1s** and **natural 20s** typically result in spectular self-inflicted wounds and damaging strikes, respectively.

#### Defending

Defending is the same process as attacking, but in reverse. The Dungeon Master rolls for each attacking creature, and deals damage if the attack rolls are higher than the defending player's Armour Class.

#### Death

If a player's HP drops below 0, they have suffered a mortal wound and can no longer attack. Each player will have three (3) turns to try to stuff their guts back in, or let other players take them out of immediate danger before they die completely. 

The other players are responsible for dragging the corpse along for the rest of the quest until it can be revived, if they so choose.

Players are encouraged to roll a back-up character in the event they want to continue playin in the current session.

<!-- ## Dungeon Mastering üêâ
_TL;DR: Make your players have as much fun as possible by being kind of a dick to them._

As a dungeon master, your job is to make the other players have as much fun as possible. 

#### Speed

Make sure that all the players at the table are engaged, and that nobody is hogging all the action. If somebody is trying to derail your game too much, feel throw to use divine intervention to throw punishments at them. 

Don't let players take too long for their turns or the game becomes boring. It really shouldn't take more than 30 seconds a turn. If this becomes a problem, use a timer.

To make sure that the game moves along quickly, if somebody asks you if they can do something, the best answer to give them is *"roll for it!"*

If the players are all playing along nicely, solving your puzzles and coming up with creative solutions to your problems, you can reward them with **inspiration points**, which acts like a currency that they can use to improve the results of their rolls.

#### Adjusting Play

Different players like different things, so feel free to adjust your campaign to suit their needs. If they like combat, throw a bunch of enemies at them. If they like exploration, create puzzles for them to solve. If they like interaction, create interesting characters for them to talk to. A good campaign will have a balance of all these.

Your players will have different motivations for playing. Newer players generally just want to aquire new weapons and armour to improve their character's fighting skills, but other players may just be more interested in discovering more about the plot of the campaign. Figure out what different people like and adjust the campaign accordingly.

### Premade Campaigns

The internet is full of pre-made campaigns of varying quality. Most of the official ones can be bought for a few bucks each, but you can also generally find the PDFs on sketchy Russian download websites.

I like the _Adventurer's League_ series because the missions are short and the files are well formatted, but because the missions are short they don't go as deep. Try to find one that's right for your players!

There are also many unofficial fan-made campaigns that are just as good as the official ones. (If you have any favorites, please send pull requests to this repository!)

### Making Your Own Campaigns

I haven't done this yet. Advice welcome!

A popular approach is to simply repurpose scenarios and characters from popular media. For instance, maybe take the plot of _Alien_ but replace the alien with a dragon. Or maybe have your adventureres go on the train-robbery mission from _Firefly_. You get the idea!

There's also no reason why your quest has to be in a Tolkein-esque fantasy universe. Just port the characters into whatever type of world you want (steampunk and sci-fi worlds are pretty popular alternatives). -->
